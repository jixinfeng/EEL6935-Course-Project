# EEL6935 [Big Data Ecosystem](http://www.andyli.ece.ufl.edu/index.php/teaching/bigdata/)

# STAY AWHILE AND LISTEN

**DON'T TAKE THE COURSE BEFORE READING THIS**

Taking this course is the biggest mistake I have ever made in my entire graduate school time

# The Good

Yes, the course is called bigdata but it's about deep learning

* You'll have a good exposure of deep learning
* You'll get some hand-on experience of some of the most popular DL topics
    * hw1 was about caffee and AlexNet

# The Bad

## You'll need a REALLY GOOD GPU

Training your neural network requires some decent computing power provided by GPU, the quad-core i7 CPU is simply too slow. At the beginning of the class, the professor promised us about accessing GPU in his lab, but nothing happend since then. Someone in class did mentioned about free trial of Google deep learning platform.

## You'll be wasting all your time on miscellaneous things

### Reading Summary

3 programming assignment doesn't sound too bad, is that right? How about 6 additional reading summaries? Remember the list of classical papers you'll read? You'll pick 6 of them and turn each of them into a reading summary. According to course website on Canvas, you are suppose to:

> Write all text word by word in a Google Doc (mandatory, no copy/paste) and make the Doc "editable with link". Submit your final version (with a link to your Google Doc in the text) in Word Doc.

> Provide a paragraph of summary about the paper, a paragraph of 3+ strong points of the paper (i.e., Why the paper should be accepted), a paragraph of 3+ weak points of the paper (i.e., why the paper should be rejected), brainstorming ideas for developing new research ideas related to the work described in the paper. The context, related work, follow-ups of the paper should also be covered. The key is your own opinions, critical evaluations, and potential new ideas or extensions.

### Paper Presentation

Among these 6 papers, one of them will be assigned to you. You'll be asked to make (according to Canvas):
> About 20 Slides + a demo if possible for 20-25 minutes

### Course Project

Don't forget the course project. What a project is without a proper proposal, midterm status report and a final report?

For proposal, you need:

* a two-page description (IEEE conference format, compact format, 10 point Arial or Times New Roman font, double column) + additional weekly progress plan
* 10 slides about your project
* Cut your slides into 4 slides when talk in the class, 4 minutes each

For midterm status report, you need:

* 4 or more pages project report
* 20 slides about your project
* Cut your slides into 8 key slides when talk in the class, 6 minutes each
* System prototype (code packages) on github.com, screenshots, more lengthy preliminary results, and documents

For final report, you need:

* 8 or more pages project report
* 20 slides about your project
* Cut your slides into 8 key slides when talk in the class, 6 minutes each
* System prototype (code packages) on github.com, screenshots, more lengthy preliminary results, and documents

Yes, for some reasons, *System Prototype* is still what is asked for *final report*, which is identical to what is in midterm report requirement. This is ironic considering what is said right beside those paragraphs in both midterm and final report requirement:

> As mentioned in the class, "1 sentence copy == plagiarism" policy. 0 sentence copy/paste. Please resubmit your midterm report in your own way. Plagiarism if found, ==> grade=0 or F and reported to the college.

Maybe copy/paste is considered plagiarism in midterm but acceptable in final?

### Poster Workshop

After finishing all the tasks in class, you are still supposed to make a poster about your project and join the *"UF Big Data Day" Poster Workshop*. You'll be standing there for about 4 hours and hopefulle have about 10-20 minutes talking to the professor and/or TA about your project.

## The things require the most time are not worth it

According to grading policy:

* Class participation and contribution (bonus): 5%
* Homework assignments, reading summary, and paper presentation: 40%
    * Programming assignments (30%)
    * Reading Summaries (5%)
    * Paper Presentation and Demo (5%)
* Course Project: 60%
    * Proposal (5%)
    * Midterm Presentation (10%)
    * Final Presentation, Demo/Code, Poster, Report (45%)

How much time is left for learning deep learning and programming your project? You should be able to figure that out by now. Good luck.

# The Ugly

## Very limited lectures

You probably already wodering: with so many presentations schduled, how much time will be left for lectures? The answer is, very limited. According to this course schedule [Course Schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M3CiaoD2gotfAdMUVtMvnxNFk2Sh5gbxsSKFbATaX30/edit?usp=sharing), number of class meetings with no lectures are:

* 1 for MLK day
* 3 for spring break
* 1 for no reason specified
* 2 for proposal presentation
* 3 for midterm presentation
* 3 for final presentation
* 15 (5 weeks) for paper presention on papers listed above!

So you'll get about 7 weeks of lecture in a 17-week semester. Is it possible to cover such an [ambitious syllabus](http://www.andyli.ece.ufl.edu/index.php/teaching/bigdata/) in 7 weeks? 

> Course Outline (tentative):
> 
> * Introduction
> * Basic Algorithms
>   * Tools: Python, R
> * Big Data Stack
>   * Tools: Spark, Hadoop, Cassandra, ZooKeeper
> * Deep Learning
>   * Regression, Classification, Dimension Reduction, Recommender Systems, Mining Data Streams
>   * DNN, CNN, RNN, DRL, Neural Computer
>   * Applications in vision, language, game, self-driving, health, business, IoT, security, science, engineering
>   * Tools: Caffe2, CNTK, MXNet, TensorFlow, PyTorch
> * Case Studies: Vision, NLP, Genomics, Security; Business, Health, IoT, Surveillance, Science, Engineering

I guess there is only one way to find out.

## NONE OF THEM WILL BE GRADED!

YES, I AM SERIOUS! None of your homework, report nor project proposal/report will be graded. Hence no feedback about your project will be given. The only grade you'll ever receive is your final course grade. So most of what you did go directly to void/oblivion.

**Still thinking about you'll survive the course? You have my best wishes, warrior.**
