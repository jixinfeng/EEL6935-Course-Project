\begin{abstract}
    The volume of text -- unstructured text especially --  on the internet 
    has been generated with a increasingly drastic speed everyday. Unlike 
    human brain, traditional computer programs lacks the ability of extracting
    useful information from unstructured text with satisfactory procision, 
    not even trivial machine learning programs, while deep learning has shown 
    some promising result. In this paper, we propose to implement a sentense
    classification program based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) as 
    our course project for EEL6935 Big Data Ecosystem.
